  "Minta Club FAQ.pdf": "Frequently asked questions\n• Why do you say that your products are chemical-free?\nOur core mission is to provide chemical-free, unadulterated food to consumers. We take great pains to ensure\nthat we go directly to the fishermen or farmers without any middlemen in between and buy the freshest of\nfresh food straight from the source. Further, we follow the most modern & scientific transportation and\npackaging processes from source till your door steps. This ensures that the required temperature and other\nconditions for healthy preservation of meats is met using nothing but natural ice as the preservative.\n• Are there really chemicals used in fish available locally? Come on, that's just your sales pitch. I\ndon't believe it!\nHow we wish that were true! We have observed that a large percentage of the fish available in the local\nmarket has Ammonia in them. A smaller percentage has Formalin.\n• How can you confidently say that your meats do not have hormones in them?\nWe take great care to ensure there are no growth promoters such as hormones, antibiotics and other bad\nstuff in the poultry that you buy from us. The growth promoter bit is easy – if you are ready to take a hit on\nthe profit margin and are ok with poultry such as chicken not growing to the largest size before slaughter,\nthen you don’t need to add any growth promoters. In fact most vendors in the market today do not add\nhormones in chicken and is a common myth. Now we take the concept to the extreme for health reasons\nand take a hit on the profitability in return for a smaller bird - that is why you see that our whole chicken is\nonly between 1-1.3 kg after cleaning, generally the chicken available in the market would be much bigger.\nThe good news though is smaller chicken is more tender and much more tastier.\n• What about antibiotics in the Chicken?\nThe antibiotics part in Chicken is a more complicated story. We ensure that we take the broiler chicken from\ninstitutional farmers who are FSSAI/HACCP certified and also conduct lab test on each batch of chicken for\nthe presence of antibiotics or other growth promoters. We also closely keep tab on the product to ensure\nthat the final meat is free of antibiotics before it reaches your doorsteps. The devil is in the details, so allow\nus to explain - Broiler Chicken is not practical to be farmed commercially without any antibiotic use in the\nearly stage of its life cycle. You could actually cause more harm than good by not giving the appropriate\nmedicines/vaccines in the early stage of growth. However in the interest of maximising profits, some of the\nmarket vendors over use antibiotics (and also other growth promoters) all the way till the bird is slaughtered.\nThe main way in which this is done is by mixing the antibiotics in the feed and water. What we do differently\nis to ensure that our farmers follow the withdrawal method - each antibiotic has a well defined half life\nperiod, which is the time it gets dissipated from the birds blood stream and body, similar to what happens to\nhuman beings when you are sick - the antibiotics from the medicines are in your blood only for a small period\nof time. Our farmers ensure that no antibiotic are used for a large period of time prior to the slaughter –\nhence there is no possibility of it coming in to the food you eat. We also ensure that there is natural minerals\nadded in the feed making the chicken more healthier. Additionally our broiler chicken are all reared at the\nsame age to avoid infections which is not the case with the chicken you get from the market. Also our rearing\nis done in large areas where the cross breed infection possibility is rare.\n\n• What about Ducks or other poultry?\nIn the case of larger birds like duck or country chicken, antibiotics are not needed at any stage as they are\nmore sturdier birds and they are reared in a free range fashion.\n• Are all your Chicken Free Range?\nNo, only the Country Chicken varieties are Free Range birds. The others are reared naturally but not in the\nopen farms which qualify for Free Range rearing.\n• How do you manage to deliver it so fresh?\nSimple - we procure the day's catch from fisherman hours after they actually fish and come to the shore. Our\nwell oil-ed processing center ensures that the fresh catch reaches our plants within no time of the catch\nlanding on the shore. At our delivery end, we have a network of vehicles that pick up the product from the\nairport/train stations and deliver to your doorsteps. We do not depend on any courier companies and have\nsourcing and delivery fully under our control - while this is expensive, it allows us to give you the worlds best\nfish in the fastest time possible from source to destination.\n• How fresh is the seafood brought from Freshtohome?\nThe fish reaches your home within a few hours of catch landing from the pond/sea- our estimate is that it is\nin your kitchen within 20 to 35 hours of catch landing at the market. The catch is not treated with chemicals\nsuch as Formalin, Chlorine or Ammonia, which means what we supply, is the safest and healthiest seafood\nyou can buy. Almost all seafood you find in your local market is invariably treated with one or other chemicals\nto preserve it. These chemicals are harmful to human beings and actually deprive the seafood of its freshness\nand natural taste.\n• How on time are you guys?\nWe have our own logistics and delivery work force, so we have a fair amount of control on our schedules.\nThe two factors that are not in our control are train and airline schedules - our two primary means of supply\nin to the Cities. However these are extra ordinary situations and barring acts of God, we deliver on time\n99.99% of the time.\n• Does the taste of fish vary from coast to coast?\nYes, there is a big difference in taste of the same fish caught in one ecosystem versus the other. For example\n- it is very well known that the best tasting Hilsa actually comes from the fresh waters in Bangladesh. Similarly\nfor Marine fish, some of the best tasting fish comes from the southern coasts of India, especially the Kerala\nbelt where there are a lot of lagoons. The waters there are comparatively pollution free and this enhances\nthe taste. The fish caught from polluted waters will generally have pollutant/toxin accumulation in the tissue\nleading to bad taste and unsavoury odour. The southern seas in general are well protected from factory\neffluents and sewage. It is also scientifically proven that the taste of the fish is directly linked to the fatty acid\nand amino acid profiles of the organisms on which they feed on! If the prey has a better nutritional profile,\nit will contribute to the profile of the predator. For example, Kerala waters are almost free from toxic\ndinoflagellates and other phytoplankton blooms which make the fish safe and tasty for consumption.\n• Why do you charge for delivery service?\nWe provide fish that is a week to a months fresher than the fish that you currently get from the market and\ndeliver that at potentially much lower prices than the local market. What this means is that we operate\n\nwith razor thin margins and for us to break even we need to add a delivery charge based on the location. As\nour volumes increase, we are hoping we can lower this cost.\n• What are the payment options supported?\nWe support both online as well as cash on delivery payment methods. No extra fees is charged for using\nany of the payment methods.\n• Is my credit card information safe on your site?\nYes. We do not store credit card details in our system. All online payment related transactions are carried\nout using trusted PhonePe/Razor pay backed payment gateway system.\n• If I pay by Credit Card / Debit Card / Net banking / UPI / Wallet, how long will it take for my\naccount to be debited?\nAfter a successful transaction, your account will get debited immediately.\n• While I was paying by net banking, my ‘session expired’. Say what?\nThis happens, simply, when you take too long to make the direct debit payment and do not manage it in the\nspecified amount of time. Go back to the mintafresh.com site and you will be presented with a page to re-\nattempt the online payment or convert the order to Cash on Delivery (COD) option.\n• I made a successful payment by net banking but the system says that the ‘verification has failed’.\nNow what?\nTo place a successful order, your payment transaction has to get verified successfully at your bank’s direct\ndebit gateway. The verification can fail because of various reasons. If you made a successful payment but the\nverification failed, do not worry. The amount debited from your account will get credited back within 7\nworking days.\n• What if the transaction fails while I am paying online using any payment method?\nGo back to the mintafresh.com site and you will be presented with a page to re-attempt the online payment\nor convert the order to Cash on Delivery (COD) option.\n• I cancelled my order which was made using online payment option (Credit Card / Debit Card / Net\nbanking / UPI / Wallet). How will I get my money back and when?\nThe account that you used for payment will get credited with the refund amount within 5-7 working days.\n• My bank is not listed in online payment option, how can I pay?\nYou can use other payment options (Credit Card / Debit Card / UPI / Wallet) to pay. In case you are unable\nto pay using any of those options, you can use Cash on Delivery option.\n• Will I be charged any additional fee for using online payment option?\nNo.\n• Grievances\n\nIf you have any complaints or suggestions about the content published on freshtohome.com, please write\nto us info@mintafresh.com\n\n",
